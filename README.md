# About Me
Hi there! I'm @D9J9V and I am a developer based on Mexico. I am passionate about Web 3 and enjoy using technology to solve problems and create new things.

On my GitHub profile, you will find a variety of projects that I have worked on, as one of my recent purposes is to share all the code I've written, including some finance related functions, some NFT related APIs, and some other random ML and AI implementations. Feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or comments.

# Contact
If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/d9j9v or send me an email at jimenezvdiego@hotmail.com. I am always open to hearing about new opportunities and connecting with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
